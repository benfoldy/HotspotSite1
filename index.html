  	<h1>Your Smartphone's Hidden Impact on Your Brain</h1>

  	<p class="byline">

  	<p> It might feel like you can't remember life without your smartphone.</p> 

	<p>That might be because studies have shown that smartphone use changes our ability to retain and remember information.</p>

	<p>Though 77 percent of Americans now own the devices, scientists are just beginning to appreciate some of the potential impacts of constant smartphone use on our brains.</p>

	<h2>Sleep cycle</h2>
	<p> For many people, a phone is the last thing they see before they go to sleep and the first thing they see when they wake up.</p>

	<p>A study in Belgium surveyed the sleep patterns of a large group, investigating how phone use at or around bedtime affected sleep.<p>

		<h2>Memory</h2>
	<p>Plenty of people use their phones to help them keep track of their schedule. But there is also evidence that over time, this reliance on phones has an impact on the brain's ability to retain and recall information.</p>

	<p>An experimental study performed at Stanford University used a battery of tests on both shorter-term "working memory" and long-term memory to see how smartphone use can affect memory. </p>

	<h2>Anxiety</h2>
	<p>Do you get anxious when you don't have your phone on you or nearby? Feel phantom buzzes in your pocket?</p>

	<p>An experimental study split subjects into a test group and a control group. Each group was given a study packet, but only one had their phones taken away in exchange for a claim check.

	<h2>Situational Awareness</h2>

	<p>Many people walk, drive and even bike with their eyes glued to their smartphones. In England, a radio journalist <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/9825625/Woman-busy-texting-walks-straight-into-freezing-cold-canal-in-Birmingham.html">fell into a canal while walking and looking at her phone.<a> An experimental study in Washington observed pedestrians walking across a square.</p>

	<p>Many of these studies were performed in the late aughts or early 2010s. Researchers are still only beginning to understand the longer-term effects of smartphones on our brains. This is part one of a forthcoming project on technology addiction.</p>

  	<h1>Your Smartphone's Hidden Impact on Your Brain</h1>

  	<p> It might feel like you can't remember life without your smartphone.</p> 

	<p>That might be because studies have shown that smartphone use changes our ability to retain and remember information.</p>

	<p>Though 77 percent of Americans now own the devices, scientists are just beginning to appreciate some of the potential impacts of constant smartphone use on our brains.</p>

	<p>Many of these studies were performed just within the past few years and researchers are still only beginning to understand the longer-term effects of smartphones on our brains. This is part one of a forthcoming project on technology addiction.</p>


	<h2>Sleep cycle</h2>
	<p> For many people, a phone is the last thing they see before they go to sleep and the first thing they see when they wake up.</p>

	<p>Graison Dangor, 28, sets an alarm on his phone before bed. He estimates that one in five nights, that will lead to an impromptu Facebook session in search of "pictures of dogs or a new podcast."</p>

	<p>Upon waking, he will often pick up where he left off the night before.</p>

	<p>"In the morning I'll try and use my phone to wake up," said Dangor. "I'll be reading and realize it's been 25 minutes of me reading articles and not really being awake."</p>

	<p>Using the phone before bed may seem innocuous, but research shows it has a significant impact on sleep patterns.</p> 

	<p>A study in Belgium surveyed the sleep patterns of a large group, investigating how phone use at or around bedtime affected sleep. It found that bedtime phone use correlated negatively to sleep outcomes, resulting in worse sleep, more insomnia, more mid-night disturbances and higher fatigue during the day.<p>

		<h2>Memory</h2>
	<p>Plenty of people use their phones to help them keep track of their schedule.</p>

	<p>"Not only is my phone sort of my north star for my day, but it's a real file cabinet for my school, my work, and my social life," said Sarah Matusek, 26.</p>

	<p>But there is also evidence that over time, this reliance on phones has an impact on the brain's ability to retain and recall information.</p>

	<p>An experimental study performed at Stanford University used a battery of tests on both shorter-term "working memory" and long-term memory to see how smartphone use can affect memory. </p>

	<p>The study found that 'heavy media-multitaskers' (e.g. those who used their phones more) performed worse on measures of both shorter-term 'working memory' and long-term memory, whether or not a phone is present.</p>

	<h2>Anxiety</h2>
	<p>That same constant reliance on the phone as a "north star" makes it that much more jarring when the phone is absent. Not having access to one's phone is now a common source of anxiety for many.</p>

	<p>"It feels unnatural to not have my phone by my side," said Matusek, as she absentmindedly checked her phone.</p>

	<p>"I also have an unhealthy habit of constantly checking my email, sometimes even just minutes apart," she said. "It's just an anxious habit for when I don't have other things to do and a way to procrastinate. It takes great restraint for me to not check my email, even when I'm out on a date or sitting in a lecture."

	<p>An experimental study split subjects into a test group and a control group. Each group was given a study packet, but only one had their phones taken away in exchange for a claim check.<p>

	<p>It found that heavy phone users became more anxious over time than people who used their phones less often, leading researchers to posit the existence of a kind of smartphone separation anxiety, the intensity of which is tied to how often one uses their phone.</p>

	<h2>Situational Awareness</h2>

	<p>Many people walk, drive and even bike with their eyes glued to their smartphones. In England, a radio journalist <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/9825625/Woman-busy-texting-walks-straight-into-freezing-cold-canal-in-Birmingham.html">fell into a canal while walking and looking at her phone.<a></p>

	<p>That's on the extreme end of outcomes, but plenty of people put themselves at risk by using their phones while they move through the world. While the risk of texting-while-driving is both well-documented and now legislated against, walking while texting can be risky as well.</p>

	<p>"I'll text while I'm walking," said Sharif Paget, 31. "Sometimes I'll even watch videos while I'm walking."</p>

	<p>"It absolutely takes me out of my surroundings and I do think it's dangerous," he said. "I've almost ran into things or gotten hit by a car."


	<p>He's not alone. An experimental study in Washington observed pedestrians walking across a square. Those on their phones were less conscientious of their surroundings-- moving slower, changing direction abruptly and failing to notice a unicycling clown that was present for the experiment. </p>
